# Undoing in Git

In Git, undoing changes is a crucial aspect of version control that allows developers to revert or modify changes made in a repository. Git offers several powerful commands to help undo changes depending on the situation:

git checkout: Switches between branches or restores files to a specific state, allowing you to discard changes in the working directory.
git reset: Moves the current branch to a previous commit, effectively undoing commits. It has different modes (--soft, --mixed, and --hard) depending on whether you want to keep or discard changes in the staging area and working directory.
git revert: Creates a new commit that undoes the effects of a previous commit without altering the commit history. This is useful for collaborative work as it preserves the commit timeline.
git clean: Permanently removes untracked files from the working directory, helpful when you want to clean up unnecessary files.
Each of these commands serves a different purpose depending on whether you need to revert changes, delete commits, or clean up files. Understanding these options ensures that you can effectively manage and correct mistakes in your Git workflow.
